<p>An attempt at piecing together components for building dynamic, customisable features into the platform. This project should result in enough work to get us to the video. At which point it is envisaged that we would move to the proper Ghost repo, with some restructure/refactoring such as -  better file and folder naming, moving Casper into a separate, but linked repo, fixing architectural errors etc.</p>

<h3 id="to-install">To Install:</h3>

<ol>
<li>Clone the git repo</li>
<li>cd into the project folder and run "npm install".
<ul><li>If the install fails with errors to do with "node-gyp rebuild", follow the Sqlite3 install instructions</li></ul></li>
<li>That is all.</li>
</ol>

<p>Frontend can be located at <a href="localhost:3333">localhost:3333</a>, Admin is at <a href="localhost:3333/ghost">localhost:3333/ghost</a></p>

<h4 id="sqlite3-install-instructions">Sqlite3 Install Instructions</h4>

<p>Ghost depends upon sqlite3, which has to be built for each OS. NPM is as smart as it can be about this, and as long as your machine has all the pre-requisites for compiling/building a C++ program, the npm install still works.</p>

<p>However, if you don't have the required pre-requisites, you will need to either get them, or as a shortcut, obtain a precompiled sqlite3 package for your OS.</p>

<p>I have created some of these, and they can be obtained from <a href="https://github.com/developmentseed/node-sqlite3/issues/106">github</a>.</p>

<p>The pre-compiled package should be downloaded, extracted and placed in the node_modules folder, such that it lives in node_modules/sqlite3, if you have a partial install of the sqlite3 package, replace it with the files you downloaded from github. Be sure that all the sqlite3 files and folders live directly in node_modules/sqlite3 - there should note be a node_modules/sqlite3/sqlite3 folder.</p>
