#Content

This section of the repo is the area that a normal user is allowed to add and change stuff. This is where their themes, plugins and images will live.

By default for an install:

* the themes directory will contain Casper
* the plugins directory will be empty
* the images directory will be empty

Currently the plugins and images directory contain some stuff for testing.

By default, Ghost will support very basic image uploads. It will be expected and encouraged for users to connect to a 3rd party service for improved media support and a CDN. Much like comments, we don't see supporting advanced file uploads, having a media library or being a CDN as core competencies - there are already plenty of people out there doing this much better than we can.
